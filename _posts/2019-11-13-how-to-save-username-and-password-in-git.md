### Run

```bash
git config --global credential.helper store
```

After running this command, when you **push** to your repository or **pull** from your repository, you'll get asked `username` and `password` for first time.

Then credentials will be stored into your home directory named `.git-credentials` file in plaintext.

You can use this command to store your credentials into cache memory for specific time(in seconds).

```bash
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=14400'
```

This command will remember your credentials for 4 hours. Your `username` and `password` will be asked for the first time during **push** or **pull** as well.

```bash
git config --global user.name "your username"
git config --global user.password "your password"
git config --global user.email "your email"
```

These commands will store your `username, password and email` in `.gitconfig` file into your home directory.
**Storing global email would help you to [count](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile#contributions-that-are-counted) your github contribution during commits.**
