### Getting Started
<br/>
1. Snap (or `Snappy` package manager) is one of the best software deployment and package management system which is built by `Canonical`.
2. A `snap` is a bundle of an app and works across many different Linux distributions as well.
3. App packages that are installed through `snap`, called `Snaps`. So `Snaps` are containerized software packages.
4. These are disclosable and installable from the `Snap Store`.
5. `snapd` is the tool for using `snaps`.


The system is actually designed for **IoT, Cloud and Desktop Computing** that are
* Easy to install
* Secured
* Cross-Platform
* Dependency-free

```bash
$ snap version
snap    2.42.1
snapd   2.42.1
series  16
