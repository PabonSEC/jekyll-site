<h3 id="what-is-linux"><i class="fas fa-edit"></i> What is Linux?</h3>

One of the most-used and best-known operating systems is **`Linux`** that distributed under an open source license. Technically it refers only to the `kernel` of the operating system. `Kernel` is the heart of any operating system which takes care of elementary stuffs. `Linux` is largely compatible with the `UNIX`.

<h3 id="how-it-differs"><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> How it differs from UNIX?</h3>

`UNIX` is the mother of all operating systems. `Linux` was basically created to be similar to `UNIX`. So commands using on both operating systems are usually the same. Programming tools, other key components are similar as well. And main part is, you have to pay for a `UNIX` kernel but `Linux` is totally free and open source.

<h3 id="linux-distributions"><i class="fas fa-list"></i> Linux Distributions</h3>

After initial realeses of `Linux` in the early `1990s`, many bundles of software came to complement the `Linux kernel` which were brought by many organizations. These bundles are called `distributions`. These are about which version of what software. `Packages` are softwares and applications that are bundled. So `Linux Distributions` are classified by these package types. There are `three` basic types of packages:


- **Debian Based Linux Distros**
- **RedHat Package Manager(RPM)**
- **Other Distributions**


#### <i class="fas fa-pen"></i> Debian Based Linux Distros

The package extension of `Debian` is `.deb`. New distributions are based on `Debian`. It's one of the oldest and very popular choice of `Linux Distributions`. Some distributions that use `.deb` packages are as follows

- **[Debian](https://www.debian.org/distrib/)**
- **[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)**
- **[Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/download.php)**
- **[antiX](https://antixlinux.com/download/)**
- **[Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)** etc.

#### <i class="fas fa-pen"></i> RedHat Package Manager

Package extension of this types of distros is `.rpm`. Distributions of this type are

 - **[CentOS](https://www.centos.org/download/)**
 - **[Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download)**
 - **[ClearOS](https://www.clearos.com/download-clearos)**
 - **[openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)**
 - **[Stella](https://stella-emu.github.io/downloads.html)** etc.

#### <i class="fas fa-pen"></i> Other Distributions

Some other distributions are

- **[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/download/)**
- **[Slackware Linux](http://www.slackware.com/getslack/)**
- **[Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/downloads/)**
- **[LXDE (Desktop Manager)](https://lxde.org/get/)** `(e.g. Lubuntu)`
- **[XFCE (Desktop Manager)](https://www.xfce.org/download)** `(e.g. Xubuntu)` etc.
