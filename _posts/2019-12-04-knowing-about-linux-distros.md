One of the most-used and best-known operating systems is **`Linux`** that distributed under an open source license. Technically it refers only to the `kernel` of the operating system. `Kernel` is the heart of any operating system which takes care of elementary stuffs. `Linux` is largely compatible with the `UNIX`.

`UNIX` is the mother of all operating systems. `Linux` was basically created to be similar to `UNIX`. So commands using on both operating systems are usually the same. Programming tools, other key components are similar as well. And main part is, you have to pay for a `UNIX` kernel but `Linux` is totally free and open source.
